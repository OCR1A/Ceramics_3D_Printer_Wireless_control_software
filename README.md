# Ceramics_3D_Printer_Wireless_control_software
This repository contains the code for a wireless ceramics 3D printer. The high-diameter nozzle reduces G-code lines, but limited RAM in low-cost microprocessors restricts script compatibility to short G-codes. Still, this project aims to help makers up to five years beyond 2024 build fully wireless DIY 3D printers.
